Note:

<Brute-Force Solution>
The ordering of if conditions is important:

When row = -1, column = n . Out of right border rule should have the precedence even though it also satisfies out of top border rule.
When row = m, column = -1. Out of bottom border rule should have the precedence even though it also satisfies out of left border rule.
Only in these two special situations , ordering of if conditions matters.
