         * Understanding Comparator Interface
         *
         * One of the major drawbacks of using a Comparable interface is that the comparing logic gets fixed. If we take
         * the example of the Vehicle class that we looked at in the previous lesson, then it can be sorted either on the
         * basis of the brand or the production year depending on the implementation of the compareTo() method.
         *
         * If we need some flexibility in sorting, we should use the Comparator interface instead of the Comparable interface.
         * The Comparator interface has a method, compare(T o1, T o2), which takes two objects, o1 and o2 as parameters.
         * It returns -1 if o1 << o2, 1 if o1 >> o2 and 0 if o1 is equal to o2.
         *
         * If we need to use the Comparator interface, then we canâ€™t use the Collections.sort(List<T> t) method as T
         * should implement the Comparable interface. There is another overloaded method, sort(List<T> list,
         * Comparator<? super T> c), that takes the list as well as a Comparator object as input. It then sorts the List
         * on the basis of logic, which is provided in the Comparator implementation.
         *
         * The below code shows how to create a custom Comparator. We will create two custom comparators: one for sorting
         * by brand and one for sorting by year.
