         * In the previous lesson, we looked at how to iterate an ArrayList using Iterator. The Iterator provides very
         * limited capabilities as we can iterate only in the forward direction and we canâ€™t update or insert an element
         * to the list while iterating. To overcome these problems, we can use ListIterator. The listIterator() method
         * returns an object of type ListIterator which can then be used to iterate the ArrayList.
         *
         * Below are the methods that are available in the ListIterator interface.
         *
         * 1. hasNext() - This method is used to check if there is a next element in the list when the list is iterated
         *    in the forward direction.
         *
         * 2. next() - This method returns the next element in the list and advances the cursor position.
         *
         * 3. hasPrevious() - This method is used to check if there is a next element in the list when the list is iterated
         *    in the backward direction.
         *
         * 4. previous() - This method returns the previous element in the list and moves the cursor position backward.
         *
         * 5. nextIndex() - This method returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call to
         *    next(). It returns the list size if the list iterator is at the end of the list.
         *
         * 6. previousIndex() - This method returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call
         *    to previous(). It returns -1 if the list iterator is at the beginning of the list.
         *
         * 7. remove() - This method removes the last element that was returned by next() or previous() from the list.
         *    This call can only be made once per call to next() or previous(). It can be made only if add() has not been
         *    called after the last call to next() or previous().
         *
         * 8. set(E e) - This method replaces the last element returned by next() or previous() with the specified
         *    element. This call can be made only if neither remove() nor add() have been called after the last call to
         *    next() or previous().
         *
         * 9. add(E e) - This method inserts the specified element into the list. The element is inserted immediately
         *    before the element that would be returned by next(), if any, and after the element that would be returned
         *    by previous(), if any.

         * Why raw type Collection should be avoided
         *
         * Whenever we create a Collection, we should provide the type of object it can hold. This is called
         * parameterized type Collection. A raw type Collection does not have any type of safety, and an object of any
         * type can be inserted into it. In the below example, we have created a raw type ArrayList. Elements of Integer
         * and String type are added to it. This code will compile but will fail at run-time with ClassCastException.
         * This would have been avoided if we had used parameterized type.
