         * Difference between Collection and Collections#
         * The differences between a Collection and Collections are given below.
         *
         * A Collection is an interface, whereas Collections is a class.
         * A Collection interface provides the standard functionality of a data structure to List, Set, and Queue. 
         * However, the Collections class provides the utility methods that can be used to search, sort, and synchronize
         * collection elements.
