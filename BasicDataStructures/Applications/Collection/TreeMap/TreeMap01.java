         * TreeMap is a class in the java.utils package that stores the keys in sorted order. Some of the features of
         * TreeMap are:
         *
         * The entries in TreeMap are sorted in the natural ordering of its keys.
         *
         * It does not allow null keys, however there can be null values.
         *
         * The TreeMap is not thread-safe, although it can be made thread-safe using the synchronizedMap() method of the
         * Collections class.
         *
         * Since a TreeMap stores the keys in sorted order, the objects that we are storing in the TreeMap should either
         * implement the Comparable interface or we should pass a Comparator while creating the TreeMap object.

        /**
         * Creating a TreeMap
         * There are four different ways to create a TreeMap object.
         *
         * Using a no-arg constructor
         * A TreeMap can be created easily using the no-arg constructor. The keys that we will store in this TreeMap must
         * implement the Comparable interface.
         *
         * Using the constructor with Comparator as an argument
         * If the objects that we are storing in a TreeMap as a key do not implement the Comparable interface or if we
         * need to store the keys in descending order, then we can provide a custom Comparator while creating the TreeMap.
         * Now, when the keys are stored in the TreeMap, they are sorted as per the logic provided by the Comparator.
         *
         * Using constructor with the argument of type Map
         * A TreeMap can be created from another Map as well. The keys are stored in ascending order irrespective of the
         * order that the elements are stored in the provided Map.
         *
         * Using constructor with the argument of type SortedMap
         * This constructor behaves as a copy constructor and creates a TreeMap with the same elements and ordering of
         * the provided sorted map.

         * Inserting elements in a TreeMap
         * Letâ€™s discuss all the methods that we can use to insert the key-value pairs in a TreeMap.
         *
         * Using the put() method
         * We can use the put(K key, V value) method to insert a key-value pair in the TreeMap. If the key is not present,
         * then a new key-value pair will be added. If the key is already present, then the value will be updated.
         *
         * Using the putAll() method
         * The putAll(Map<? extends K, ? extends V> m) method copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this
         * map. These mappings will replace any mappings that this map had for any of the keys currently in the specified
         * map.
